If you are here, then you've probably heard that I run a couple of tech meetups in Sydney and beyond. The three meetups I run in Sydney are:

- [Sydney Serverless](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Serverless-Meetup-Group/ "Sydney Serverless")
- [Sydney DataEng](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Data-Engineering-Meetup/ "Sydney DataEng")
- [Sydney dbt](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-dbt-Meetup/ "Sydney dbt")

I've been organising meetups for roughly 4-5 years and in that time, I've built up a couple of tricks that help me save time when finding new speakers.

## Get structured data

There are four simple questions I ask prospective meetup speakers, and they are the following:

- name, job title, company
- talk title
- talk summary
- bio

Now that may not sound like a lot of info but it can be very revealing about who your speaker is and whether they are a good fit for your meetup as well as how ready they are to present.

It is also a great time saver as I pretty much copy and paste the information into the meetup page! :D

## Job title and company

A job title and company can very quickly tell you a lot about a speaker - I don't mean this from an elitist perspective - far from it in fact as no one at a tech meetup wants to hear from a c-suite executive, far removed from the tools. A job title can give away hints about how day to day this person is on the tech they are talking about as well as potential red flags if they are someone in sales or recruitment who may not have the best interest of the meetup community at heart.

## talk title and summary

Someone who can quickly rattle these details off in a succinct manner typically will have a very good idea of what they will present and are often ready at short notice. Watch points are verbose summaries and scattered thoughts - anything that screams a disjointed story, and you may want to get back to that speaker and provide further coaching until they have clarity in their summary.

## bio

This will often indicate whether a speaker has done this before or not (or is a regular on the speaking circuit). I'm not put off in the slightest by a bio that isn't very well crafted (or is clearly from a junior). Getting newcomers to present at your meetup is what it's all about and is another coaching point for a generous organiser.

## Final thoughts

I hope you found this post insightful - it's perhaps not the most complicated thing you will read today but I hope this little nugget of wisdown can save you some time.
