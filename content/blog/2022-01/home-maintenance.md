2021 was year of many challenges but one really nice positive was the opportunity to purchase a 5 bedroom family home that allowed my wife and 2 boys a bit more space.

However, moving from a 2 bedroom townhouse, where most major maintenance is sorted by strata, to a 450 square meter block with hedges and gardens means Iâ€™ll need to upgrade some of my tools to handle the additional work.
