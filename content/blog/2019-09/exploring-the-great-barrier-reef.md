# Exploring the Great Barrier Reef

We kicked off any great family holiday with plenty of excitement and a bit of relief that we managed to get through airport security in time.

## 2 nights in Port Douglas

Port Douglas was a beautiful spot with a lovely beach, a massive Sunday Markets as well as plenty of forests close by to explore.

## A quick stay in Cairns

We stayed at the Shangri-La and had a great view of the marina from the hotel.

## Off to Green Island

Green Island was super fun and such a beautiful spot to connect with nature.

## Day trip to the Outer Reef

Definitely one of the funner aspects was going to the outer reef - an hour boat ride for some really good snorkelling and scuba diving.

## Back in Cairns and then off to Sydney

And as quickly as we started our journey, we were headed back to Sydney - it was a bunch of fun though and we really enjoyed it!
