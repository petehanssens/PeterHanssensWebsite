As I mentioned earlier in the series, I’ve got a bunch of hedges which look amazing but require regular maintenance.

I’ve also got patchy grass throughout the property so owning a lawn mower is a bit of an overkill and probably the wrong tool for the job.

Speaking to one of my brothers who is a timer floorer by trade and generally quite handy around the place, he mentioned a Makita multi function power head with attachments - I went for the hedge and line trimmer attachments and it came with a free blower which was perfect for my requirements:

I’ve been super impressed by the balance of the tool given it’s got two 18V batteries on it’s head and how easy it was to get up and running so naturally, this will not be the last tool I buy from Makita!

It’s worthwhile noting that Makita have released a 40V range which you can obviously go for but I felt given this is not my day job, the 18V range was sufficient for household tasks
